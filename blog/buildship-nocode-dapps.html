    <h1>🚢 Buildship – No-code Decentralized Apps builder</h1>
    
    <p>Today, if you want to build a decentralized app (dApp), you need two things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>smart-contract</li>
      <li>website (aka frontend)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Smart-contract describes the logic of how funds and tokens will interact, and the website gives an ability for everyone to use the smart-contract via simple interface.</p>
    
    <p>Building a smart-contract is hard. But you can make use of existing templates (e.g. OpenZeppelin), and you can connect to existing smart-contracts (Uniswap). Even if you need custom logic, usually it's a time well-spent – you're venturing into the territory of untested economies.</p>
    
    <p>On the other hand, all the frontend work is pointless. It's repetitive, boring and doesn't give value except for letting someone to use your smart-contract. Do you feel the pain yet? Maybe I'm not the only one experiencing this?</p>
    
    <p>That's why I started working on <a href="https://buildship.dev/" target="_blank">buildship.dev</a> – the big vision is to remove the need to hire a React+web3 developer at all, and focus only on smart-contract and on your UI!</p>
    
    <p>Buildship is a no-code builder for blockchain apps. It can connect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to your custom smart-contract,</li>
      <li>deploy smart-contract from a set of predefined templates: ERC20 tokensales, NFTs</li>
      <li>to external smart-contracts like Uniswap or Compound</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Building a visual interface frontend, is as easy as drag-n-dropping elements, like in Webflow, Tilda or Wordpress.</p>

    <p>P.S. In parallel, am also working on a small opinionated framework that allows any React developer to build web3 app without getting into the details about transactions, blockchain, gas and all the stuff.</p>
